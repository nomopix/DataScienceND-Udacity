# AirBnB Barcelona

## Introduction
The first project on the <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025">Data Science Nanodegree by Udacity</a> consists of analysing a dataset using three initial questions to help the exploration. 

### Steps
The key steps for this project are:
1. Pick a dataset
2. Pose at least three questions related to business or real-world applications of how the data could be used.
3. Create a Jupyter Notebool to prepare, analyze, model and visualize the data.
4. Communicate business insights by creating a Github repository to share code and data wrangling techniquest and a blog post to share the questions and insights to non-technical audience.

### The process
The process recommended on the course for this is  <a href="https://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/crisp-dm-a-standard-methodology-to-ensure-a-good-outcome">CRISP-DM</a>, which is an industry standard process for data mining:

* Business Understanding
* Data understanding
* Prepare Data
* Model Data
* Results
* Deploy

### Chosen Data set: Barcelona AirBnB July 2019

I decided to choose the Barcelona <a href="http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html">AirBnB dataset</a> (with the help of the course's menthor as I couldn't decide!) mainly because I studied there (quite a while ago) and it'd be a really interesting dataset which I could relate to.

### Files
* AirBnB-BCN-July2019Extract-Analysis jupyter notebook
* Data files

#### Data
I opted for creating a folder named "data" with all the different datasets downloaded from AirBnB (in gz format), which are the following:

* <b>calendar.csv</b>: which contains detailed calendar data for listings in Barcelona
* <b>listings-sum.csv</b>: which contains summary information and metrics for listings in Barcelona (good for visualizations)
* <b>listings-det.csv</b>: which contains detailed listings
* <b>neighbourhoods.csv</b>: which is a list of geo filter, sourced from city or open source GIS files
* <b>reviews-sum.csv</b>: Summary Review data and Listing ID (to facilitate time based analytics and visualisations linked to a listing).
* <b>reviews-det.csv</b>: Detailed Review Data for listings in Barcelona
