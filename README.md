## Why this repo of projects?

During 2019 I decided to expand my knowledge of data and explore a bit more closely into the exciting world of Data Science using python. 

There are many concepts that I already knew that not only have a "new name" but have expanded quite massively with the amount of data generated every second, and more established methods of exploration of data cannot handle them in the same way. 

I'm hoping as a result of this course I have a better understanding of data science and a stronger set of tools in my toolbelt to handle interesting and exciting data projects.

I created this repo to include all the different projects covered on the course (whether optional or mandatory) and have them all together in one single repository for easy access and future reference.

<i><b>Please note that this is a work in progress and it will be updated as I progress through the course</b></i>
